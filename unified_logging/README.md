# Unified Log Filtering

The Unified Logging system available in macOS 10.12 or later provides a central location to store log data on the Mac. The Console and Terminal apps allow users to view, stream, and filter this data on computers to manually troubleshoot errors or detect threats.

You can use the example Unified Logging filters to capture data generated by Jamf Connect for discovery or troubleshooting purposes.

With solutions like Jamf Protect, you can use the same predicate-based filter criteria that are often used with the `log` command to collect relevant log entries from computers and send them to a security information and event management (SIEM) solution or a third party storage solution (e.g., AWS).

## Unified Log Filters

This repository contains example predicate filters that can be used to stream telemetry on a variety of events across macOS. Filters are available for macOS users, system and network activity, and third-party applications including Jamf Connect and Jamf Pro.

## Implementing Unified Log Filters in Jamf Protect from this repository

If you use Jamf Protect or another tool that can stream Unified Log data to a remote endpoint, see the [Jamf Protect GitHub repository](https://github.com/jamf/jamfprotect/tree/main/unified_log_filters) for more examples that can be used to stream user or device information.

## Enabling Private Data from the Unified Log

By default, the Unified Log will redact information that is considered sensitive, such as computer or user identifiers. In some cases, such as that in which the computer is a institutionally-owned and managed, there may be a need to ascertain such information; therefore, private data logging can be enabled via a configuration profile. See [Unified Logs: How to Enable Private Data](https://www.jamf.com/blog/unified-logs-how-to-enable-private-data/) blog from Jamf to learn more.

Data from the Unified Log on macOS that are redacted can be identified by the presence of `<private>` in the returned log output. For example, a log entry in the Unified Log for a user password change looks like the following:

`Password changed for <private>`

The same string returned on a device with private data logging enabled would be:

`Password changed for <your-username>`
